            Acknowledging Indigenous Histories and Contributions
            As we present geotagged historical photographs, we acknowledge that these locations often carry deep and complex histories that predate colonial narratives. Many of the places represented in our project are on lands that have been stewarded by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years. These lands hold cultural, spiritual, and historical significance that may not be visible in the colonial-era photographs featured in the Flickr Commons archive.
            We can acknowledge these histories by taking the following steps:
            <li>Including Land Acknowledgments: Where possible, we will incorporate land acknowledgments into the interface, recognizing the Indigenous peoples whose lands are featured in the photos.</li>
            <li>Highlighting Indigenous Narratives: We will explore ways to include metadata or supplementary information that provides Indigenous context to the photos or regions displayed.</li>
            <li>Diversifying the Archiveâ€™s Representation: While the archive itself may reflect a colonial bias, we will actively seek ways to elevate and integrate underrepresented voices, working with stakeholders to identify opportunities for collaboration with Indigenous communities and organizations.</li>
